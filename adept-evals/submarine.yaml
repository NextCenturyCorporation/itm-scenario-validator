name: Electrical accident

state:

  unstructured: >
    You are an IDC (the only medical provider) on a submarine, and you respond to a bad electrical accident. The Electrician Chief required one of the Electrician's mates to work during their sleep cycle (coming off duty) to repair an electrical issue with the treadmill. A sailor who had been bugging the chief about getting it fixed for his own use was hanging around in his exercise clothes, waiting for it to be done. During the repair, there was a small electrical fire and both sailors (electrician's mate and bystander) were seriously injured. They are reported to have similar injuries.
    Crew mates are bringing the patients to you in the wardroom. The corridor is tight and they can only bring one at a time.

        Crewmate says "It looks like the electrician's mate did not secure power, the most basic and important safety step, before initiating the repair! The accident was due to his serious negligence. There's no reason it had to happen and now two people are hurt. I'm sure this will be a serious black mark on his record."

        You have walked to the patients.

        Sailor Bloom says, "I guess we shouldn't have been horsing around and throwing the dumbbells. I heard a loud crack when the last dubmbell hit the treadmill, and the next thing I know is that we were both on the floor."
        A new patient has been discovered.  They seem to have experienced a jolt from an electrical surge cause by the accident.  They are in another part of the submarine.  They have a pre-existing medical condition and may be having a heart attack.  Treating him will take time and constant monitoring so you would have to leave these two unattended in order to go treat him.
