# v1.3.0
# Change from v1.2.0:
#     Changed injuries:
#       Shooter now has a bicep injury instead of a neck injury to increase chance that shooter's injuries are interpreted as treatable by the medic.
#       Victim now also has those injuries plus a torso injury, to increase change that their injuries may have complications that cannot be properly handled w/o advanced surgery.
#       For the evac scenes, the fact that the injuries are treated was added to the unstructured and unstructured_postasses to be better match the description in https://nextcentury.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ITMC/pages/3091038209/ADEPT+Metrics+Evaluation+Scenarios#TA3-Version-Urban

        You are at a scene where a civilian shooter attacked another civilian.  The shooter was then shot by local security.
        While you were treating your patient, a civilian medic arrived and treated the other patient.
        The shooter is likely to survive.  The victim may not survive.
        The closest mility hospital has agreed to take a civilian patient and med-evac is on the way.
        You are the scenario authority on scene and must now decide who to med-evac to the military hospital.
        The bystander says, "You did your best for this guy, but his prognosis looks really bad. In his condition, he is very unlikely to even survive being transported."
        Who do you evacuate?
