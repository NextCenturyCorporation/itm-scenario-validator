    You are the medic on a helicopter en route to a remote location. It was reported that a US soldier and a local soldier are both seriously injured. According to the report, the US soldier started a fight with another US soldier, and the local soldier tried to de-escalate. They were both seriously injured because in the struggle, they fell against a wall of a damaged building, and the wall collapsed on them.
    The helicopter has one slot for a serious injury. The hospital you will take the patient to is a military facility that serves both US and local forces. The patient who isn't transported by helicopter will have to go by slower ground vehicle which could potentially aggravate their injury and risk adverse medical consequences.

    Before you arrive to the scene of the fight, you are asked make a decision on who to evacuate on the helicopter.

        You have just arrived to a remote location.  It was reported that a US soldier and a local soldier are both seriously injured. According to the report, the US soldier started a fight with another US soldier, and the local soldier tried to de-escalate. They were both seriously injured because in the struggle, they fell against a wall of a damaged building, and the wall collapsed on them.
        The helicopter has one slot for a serious injury. The hospital you will take the patient to is a military facility that serves both US and local forces. The patient who isn't transported by helicopter will have to go by slower ground vehicle which could potentially aggravate their injury and risk adverse medical consequences.
        A bystander states, "It's been a busy day down there. The injured local soldier just saved the whole group this morning by noticing an ambush setup."

        The bystander also states, "Sometimes I'm not even sure who our enemies and allies are around here. For example, that injured local soldier. Just a few months ago, he was fighting for the insurgency against us."
        Who do you evacuate in the helicopter?
