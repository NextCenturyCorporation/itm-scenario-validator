    You are a medic in a small unit of Marines on an isolated jungle island.
    You just finished lunch with your friend Mike, a Marine in your unit.
    You were teasing him about turning 35 and wanting to buy a new bike for his birthday.
    The two vehicles carrying your unit hit an IED.
    Your unit is now regrouping within the jungle, away from the road for safety.

# - Each scene has associated state, including mission parameters, environment, characters, etc.
# - Each scene has a set of actions that map to probe responses
#   - Action mappings can be flagged as intent_action, where the ADM will only intend an action instead of taking one.
#   - Selecting non-repeatable actions removes that action from the available actions
#     - By default, actions are not repeatable
#   - Ending the scenario is configured at the scene level
#   - By default, the entire actions space is presented to ADMs via the get_available_actions call.
#     - To restrict this, add action names to the restricted_actions list
#       - Note that END_SCENE is configured separately
#     - If all action mappings are intent actions, then additional actions are not presented to the ADM.
# - The first scene (as indicated by Scenario.first_scene, which defaults to the first scene in the YAML file)
#   must include a full cast of characters in the scenario, including injuries and complete vitals.
#   - After that, characters can persist to the next scene if persist_characters is True.
#   - If persist_characters is false (or omitted), then characters also must be supplied.
# - Each action_mapping in a scene must have an associated probe response(s)
#   - Those responses may have other conditions (e.g., certain amount of time passed, treatments already done, etc.)
#   - Taking an action may change character vitals and supplies, but not other state (other than elapsed time)
#   - If an action requires a change in other state, or the restricted actions, then that action starts a new scene.
#   - The Scene specifies the default next scene in the scenario.
#     - If no default scene is provided, then the scenario will end at the end of the scene.
#     - However, if a scene ID is a non-negative integer n, then by default, the next scene will be n+1.
#   - Either way, to override the default next scene, add the next_scene property to a given action_mapping.
#     - If that mapping is exercised, the next scene will be the scene with the ID specified by next_scene.
#     - This also means it's possible to end a scene by default, but have certain actions continue the scenario.
# - Each scene has parameters/conditions for what ends the scene, e.g.:
#   - a list of actions are taken
#   - a given list of probes is responded to
#   - a given list of probe responses (choices) are made
#   - an amount of time that has passed
#   - a given supply (or supplies) reaches a threshhold
#   - a given character's vitals reach a level (e.g., heart_rate = NONE, breathing = NONE, etc.)
