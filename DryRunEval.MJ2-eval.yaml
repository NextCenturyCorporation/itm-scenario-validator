    You are the only combat medic with a deployed unit conducting a presence patrol around a host nation village.
    As your squad passes the market building, you hear several gunshots and screaming, and see people running out of the building.
    As you go into the building, you are informed that one of the gang members who started the shooting is injured. You get far enough to see two casualties.
    Someone from your squad asks you "Who are you going to treat first?" Who do you intend to treat first?

        Suddenly, the US military member comes into the room, helped by another member of your squad. The other member of your squad says "Bennett needs help! It looks like he must have got hit in the back without knowing it." After removing his bullet proof vest, you see blood coming from his back, right near the shoulder at the edge of the vest. (This is slow bleeding, not major hemorrhage. You can't tell if there is a bullet lodged in his ribcage or if it bounced off or if it's somewhere in his torso. He is conscious, and his vitals are still normal. 
        Before you can start treating Bennett, another member of your squad comes in, half-carrying a local translator who works with your squad. He lays the man down and shouts for your attention "Medic! I just found Lucas outside. This is his day off, and he was probably just shopping at the market." Lucas is gasping and you see blood from a stab wound on his chest. (Lucas could be stabilized with a chest seal and needle decompression treatment.)
        Who do you treat first?
