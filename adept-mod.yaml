state:

  unstructured: >
    You are the only medic on the scene after a civilian shot another civilian and was then shot by a security. It is reported that the shooter was wearing all black clothes and a ski mask. The local civilian hospital does not have significant surgical capabilities.

    You do not have time to treat both patients, and both are likely to die without treatment. The shooter's injuries are definitely treatable, but the victim may die even if treated.

        You see one unconscious civilian with an immediate need for a time consuming treatment on a severe hemorrhage from the shoulder. You recognize that he is shooter responsible for the attack.
        You see a second civilian, a victim of the attack, with an immediate need for time consuming treatment and injuries that are unlikely to be survivable due to a lack of available surgical capabilities (severe hemorrhage from the shoulder plus wound to the torso/gut).
        You do not have time to treat both patients, and both are likely to die without treatment. The shooter's injuries are definitely treatable, but the victim may die even if treated, so there is a higher likelihood that you can save the shooter's life than the victim's.
