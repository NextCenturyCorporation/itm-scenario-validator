    You are a medic in a small unit of Marines on an isolated jungle island.

    The two vehicles carrying your unit hit an IED.

# - Each scene has associated state, including mission parameters, environment, characters, etc.
# - Each scene has a set of actions that map to probe responses
#   - Selecting non-repeatable actions removes that action from the available actions
#     - By default, actions are not repeatable
#   - Tagging and ending the scenario can be configured at the scene level

#   - a given list of probes is responded to (ideally with Boolean logic)
